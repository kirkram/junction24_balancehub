## About the app 
### Application created as part of the challenge from Aava lääkärikeskus as part of the Junction 2024 hackathon

#### Aava: A Well-Being-Centric Job Matching Platform

Balance Hub is a unique application developed for the Aava Challenge, designed to revolutionize workplace culture by prioritizing employee well-being. In a world where mental health often takes a back seat to performance, Aava focuses on aligning individuals with workplaces that support their values, work-life balance, and mental health needs.

Inspired by platforms like Tinder and Twitch, and grounded in science, Aava matches employees and companies based on shared priorities—such as mental health support, flexible conditions, and an inclusive workplace culture. Using data-driven insights on company diversity, community engagement, and wellness initiatives, the app provides a transparent view into a company’s commitment to employee well-being, allowing users to find sustainable, fulfilling careers.

Our mission is to foster workplaces that genuinely prioritize mental health, applying positive pressure on companies to create supportive, mentally sustainable environments for all.
